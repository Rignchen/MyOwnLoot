This datapack is inspiered by the [lootr](https://modrinth.com/mod/lootr) mod.<br>
This datapack allows a chest to be loot by multiple players, the chests can't be opened by a player if it's currently opened by another player.<br>
<br>
The first time a player open a chest, the chest will keep the items generated by the loot table, then every time he open the chest, it will get the items he put in the chest.<br>
Every time a player close a chest, the loot table is put back in the chest and the content of the chest is stored before beeing cleared.<br>
If a player destroy a chest, all the content stored for every player is lost.<br>
